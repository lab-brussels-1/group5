# Retrospective

## What was not clear, where did we get stuck?

- I think we had a lot of trouble when we were changing files and git pushing.
  However from this mistake we have learned that we have plan very well our
  steps in order to prevent this kind of errors
- Sometime we were confused where we can find the files
- We did not start with the planning, therefore, communication was hard and it
  took way more time as we have to explain it to those who couldn't make it to
  the meetings.
- Sometime we were confused where we can find the files
- I think we had a lot of trouble when we were changing files and git pushing.
  However from this mistake we have learned that we have plan very well our
  steps in order to prevent this kind of errors
- I thin we had some problem at the begging as we didn't know well how to create
  planing documents and how to use them properly.
- I think we got confused at the beginning and did not start with the planning.
  Also, we got into many communication issues.

## What was clear, what did we master?

- Creating the md files
- Always git pull before make any changes
- Knowing others' schedules and working styles
- Some html and css skills
- Planning as team each task, how and when to be performed
- Using css/html and npm commands to check our codificaction
- We also learned the base for creating a project, and what we should take in
  count when we want to do a project
- How to resolve the conflicts and run all the lint, css and HTML checks.

## Where can we still use some help?

- How to work collaboratively (still the biggest problem for us)
- Solving some lintng conflicts
- How to work in the group more effectively and correctly.
- HTML & CSS

## Where can we help others moving forwards?

- Those who are more experienced or available more should set some time off to
  help others
- Working in local machine , creating new branch and other steps until creating
  pull Requests and reviewing the others PR and merging it
- I had a lot of help from my teammates, i was not aware if what i needed to do,
  telling someone what he/she has to do pointing out from where he can get
  certain information or base his/her work can be very useful
- Took lot of help from teammates. Also taking time to understand.

# The Course

## What can there be more of?

- All the subjects have multiple choices
- Everything is fine, i have nothing to say
- I would like to have more practical tasks as already understand the way to
  learn coding is daily workout.
- As a beginner, i felt enough content to check.

## What can there be less of?

- On my opinion very good comment left my group mate Elias so I don't have
  nothing extra to say.
- All the subjects have multiple choices
- Less reading more practice, i think that Web developing can be tough if you do
  not know the concepts, but if you want to learn the concepts you have to put
  it in practice so you make mistakes and you learn from them and by consequence
  you will consolidate the knowledge
- As the content is more to read, sometimes it is confusing as well.

## What material were most helpful (from HYF or elsewhere)?

- Youtube videos
- [Traversy - HTML Crash Course For Absolute Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE)
- [Traversy - CSS Crash Course For Absolute Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI)
- Youtube videos have helped me
- For me really helps a lot live meeting with coaches in zoom and video like
  @Tamer did.
- HYF & Google

## What HYF material was least helpful?

- Nothing, everything was well used
- Nothing is less helpful so far, all the info that you have is enough and get
  you right to the point
- The all material was great and really helpful. just need to learn how to use
  that most effectively.
- I felt everything was helpful

## Any suggestions for future classes?

- Would be nice to make the team more diverse based on team members' background.
  We can complement each other this way
- Perhaps, when explaining the deliverables (especially in this case), rather
  than focusing on the actual deliverables, more attention should be given to
  the prioritized tasks e.g. planning and communication. We were led immediately
  to the technical steps rather than planning. Something for us to learn too of
  course
- Just to take us more into practice, otherwise everything else is perfect
- As for me would be great if each team will have person who has some background
  as in some difficult situation it can help for the group work better. Plus,
  during the group project other members can learn a lot from this person.
- For me its good, however lot of practices to be carried out.
